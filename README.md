# RubikSolver
5C Hackathon Project, Fall 2015

Interface with a robot designed to turn the faces of a cube. Analyze images of the cube, generate a solution, and solve the physical cube using the robot.

This branch contains the code as it was when we finished the hackathon. The code here is mostly deprecated now, but we will keep this branch open for reference.
